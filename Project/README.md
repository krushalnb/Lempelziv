<h1 align="center">Lempel-ziv coding for text file</h1>

## Description

This python project will help you to encode and decode your text file with Lempel-ziv coding.
I have created two files encode file for encode the input text file and decode file for decode generated encoded file.



## Running the Test

Open the command window and provide the below command to run the project.

1. For encoding the text file you have to provide below command
```
   python encode.py <inputfilename.txt> <number of bits> 
```
2. For decoding you have to provide below command
```
   python decode.py <inputfilename.lzw> <number of bits>
```

## Result
 
 After successfully running the first command system will generate file as below.
 ```
 <inputfilename>.lzw
 ```
 
 After successfully running the second command system will generate file as below.
 ```
 <inputfilename>_decode.txt
 ```
